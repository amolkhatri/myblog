## Introduction

JavaScript closures are a fundamental concept that every developer should understand. They allow functions to access variables from an enclosing scope, even after that scope has finished executing.

## What is a Closure?

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.

## Example

Here's a simple example of a closure: 

```javascript
    function makeCounter() {
        let count = 0;
        return function() {
            count += 1;
            return count;
        };
    }
    const counter = makeCounter();
    console.log(counter()); // 1
    console.log(counter()); // 2
```

In this example, the inner function maintains access to the `count` variable even after `makeCounter` has finished executing.

## Conclusion

Closures are a powerful feature in JavaScript that can be used to create private variables, implement partial application, and more. Understanding how they work will greatly enhance your ability to write effective JavaScript code.
